== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wpservio` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. Go to **WpServio → Settings** and choose your Custom Post Type
4. Create a page and add the `[wpservio_my_account]` shortcode for the client account dashboard (orders, invoices, profile). Optionally, add `[wpservio_account]` in your header/navbar as a login/avatar widget.
5. *(Premium)* Configure Stripe under **WpServio → Stripe** — paste your API keys and webhook secret
6. *(Premium)* Configure email notifications under **WpServio → Notifications**

**WP Cron (for automatic payment links)**

On low-traffic sites, add a real system cron job for reliable daily scheduling:
`* 8 * * * curl https://yoursite.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Custom Post Types are supported? =

Any public Custom Post Type registered on your site. Configure it in WpServio → Settings.

= Is Stripe required? =

No. Without Stripe (free plan), orders follow a manual chat-based workflow. Enabling Stripe (premium) adds automatic payment collection via Stripe Checkout.

= Can I customise the chat appearance? =

Yes. You can change the accent colour and chat button position (bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, top-right) from the settings page. All UI elements adapt to the chosen colour automatically.

= What payment modes does Stripe support? =

Four modes per service: single payment, 50% deposit + balance on delivery, installments (40% upfront + N monthly payments), or pure monthly subscription.

= Where is the webhook URL for Stripe? =

Go to **WpServio → Stripe** in your admin. The webhook URL is displayed there — copy it into your Stripe Dashboard under Developers → Webhooks. Select the `checkout.session.completed` event.
